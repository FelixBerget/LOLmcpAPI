This is the collection of the MCP and the Skill i use in Claude to genrate full match reports and to make them graphically impressive.

The txt file is just the text to generate the Skill without getting the skill directly yourself since it is not readable in GitHub.

The skill file is here and should be plug and play just upload it.

The server.py file aka the MCP should also just be to download and then edit the config so that it gets used.
