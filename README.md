This is the collection of the MCP and the Skill i use in Claude to genrate full match reports and to make them graphically impressive.

The txt file is just the text to generate the Skill without getting the skill directly yourself since it is not readable in GitHub.

The skill file is here and should be plug and play just upload it to your Claude.

The MCP files aka the python related files are of course server.py which is the MCP, but also the dependency and version controls.
This can be put in its own folder and then connected via the config. This will give access to a skill called "riot" this is the right one.
